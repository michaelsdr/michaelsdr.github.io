Hello! My name is Michael Sander and I am a PhD student at ENS Paris working with Gabriel Peyré and Mathieu Blondel on building and studying new deep learning models. 
I graduated from École Polytechnique in 2020 and have a master degree from ENS Paris-Saclay in mathematics, vision and machine learning (MVA), as well as a master degree from Sorbonne Université in mathematics (modeling).  

Research interests

My main research interests are at the intersection between deep learning, dynamical systems, optimal transport and differentiable learning.
